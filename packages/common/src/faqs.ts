    question: "How does the Probable Pitcher service work?",
    answer:
      "Probable Pitcher is a notification service that sends you a notification when a pitcher you are subscribed to is scheduled to pitch.",
  },
  {
    question: "What types of notifications will I receive?",
    answer:
      "You will receive one notification in the morning if one or more pitchers you are subscribed to pitch that day. You may receive additional notifications throughout the day if there are schedule updates that add a pitcher you are subscribed to.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why am I not receiving notifications?",
    answer:
      "Check your application settings and make sure notifications are enabled. Our service makes a best effort to send you notifications, but we cannot guarantee that you will receive them.",
  },
  {
    question: "My subscriptions are gone, where are they?",
    answer:
      "Subscriptions are tied to the account linked with your identity manager, like Google or Apple. So for instance, if you logged in previously with your Google account and added subscriptions, then later accessed the service with your Apple account, your Google account's subscriptions will not be available.",
